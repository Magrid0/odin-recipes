            <h2 class="preparation preparation-title">Preparation</h2>
            <p class="preparation preparation-steps">Rag√π sauce: heat 3 table spoons of olive oil in a large saucepan on a medium heat. Add carrot, onion and celery peeled and finely chopped. Stir for around 15 minutes until the mixture is lightly colored.

                Add the two types of meat, earlier minced, and stir breaking up meat with the spoon until the color is well brown. Pour the wine and mix until the alcool is evaporated. Add the tomato sauce, a glass of water, a generous pinch of salt and two bay leaves.
                
                Turn the heat down and cook on low heat for at least 2 hours with lid. Stir occasionally. If the sauce start to dry out add a splash of water.
                
                This sauce can be made in advance and kept in the fridge 2-3 days. If you want you can also chilled it.
                
                B√©chamel: melt butter in a pan over medium heat. Add flour and stir until the mixture becomes like a cream. Pour in very warm milk and whisk vigorously until you have a smooth white sauce. Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce heat and cook for at least 10 minutes.
                
                Assembly: lasagne sheets can be used without precooking only if they are fresh. If you have the dry ones cook them in boiling water according to the instructions of the package (usually4-5 minutes).
                
                Spread three spoon of rag√π into the bottom of a earthenware ovenproof dish (25x35cm approx.). Follow with a layer of lasagne sheets, add a third of your rag√π and a third of b√©chamel. Repeat the process (sheets, rag√π and b√©chamel) two more time and top with grated parmesan.
                
                Preheat oven to 200¬∞C. Bake the lasagne for 20 minutes until beginning to brown on top. Leave the dish 20 minutes before serving.
